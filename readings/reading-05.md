# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Inheritance
This property allows for properties and behaviors to be passed down from a parent class. This is helpful because it allows for similar classes to share properties and behaviors so that they do not need to be rewritten. This is written in code as `class <class name> extends <parent class name> {}`

## Interfaces
These act like contracts between the class and the outside world. Because a class cannot be derived from multiple parent classes, interfaces act an an alternative. Classes can implement from multiple interfaces and have to implement the behaviors from the interface. An interface is declared using the `interface` keyword and a class implements the in the class signature with `class <class name> implements <interface name> {}`.
