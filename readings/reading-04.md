# Object Oriented Programming and Numbers

## OOP Concepts
Object: An object is a piece of code that has a grouping of properties and behaviors, similar to the way real life objects can have properties to describe them and actions they can perform.
<br>
Class: A class acts as the blueprint from which objects are created, or instantiated, from.
<br>
Inheritance: Objects can inherit from other objects. This allows object types to be structurally organized where properties and behaviors are passed down from parent to child.
<br>
Interface: Similar to inheritance, an object can implement an interface and therefore has to have all the properties and behaviors that are inside of the interface.
<br>
Package: A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces. This is essentially part of the file structure that allows for easy organization.
<br>

## Numbers
Binary: Base 2 number system consisting of 0's and 1's.
<br>
Decimal: Base 10 number system. This is the numbering system most people are accustomed to using.
<br>
Hexadecimal: Base 16 number system. After the numbers 0 through 9, the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are replaced with A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively.
