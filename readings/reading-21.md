# GraphQL @connection

## Connections in GraphQL
The @connection directive enables you to specify relationships between @model types. Currently, this supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships. You may implement many-to-many relationships using two one-to-many connections and a joining @model type. See the usage section for details.
