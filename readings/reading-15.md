# Android Fundamentals

## Fundamentals and Info:
- Android apps are typically written using Kotlin, Java, or C++ languages.
- The Android SDK tools compile code and additional resource files into an Android Package file (APK).
- The Android OS is a multi-user Linux system where each app is its own user.
- Each process has its own VM, so code from each app is run in isolation.
- Apps can work with/access other apps, but the permission has to be explicitly given by the user.

## Core Components
- Activities: the entry point for interacting with the user
- Services: a general purpose entry point for keeping the app running in the background
- Broadcast Receivers: a component that allows the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular flow
- Content Providers: manages a set of app data that you can store in the file system or any persistent data storage location
