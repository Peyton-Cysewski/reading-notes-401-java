# Java Basics

## Language Basics
Variables and More
- Instance: Values are unique to each "instance".
- Static: Only one "instance" overall.
- Local: Exists only in the scope of a method or class.
- Parameters: Always exist in the local scope of a method; Always a variable, not a field.
- Primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.
- Arrays: A container object that holds a fixed length of the same type of data.

Operators
- Postfix: `expr++ expr--`
- Unary: `++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !`
- Multiplicative:  `* / %`
- Additive: `+ -`
- Relational:	`< > <= >= instanceof`
- Equality: `== !=`
- Logical AND:	`&&`
- Logical OR: `||`
- Ternary: `? :`
- Bitwise AND: `&`
- Bitwise exclusive OR:	`^`
- Bitwise inclusive OR:	`|`
- Shift: `<< >> >>>`
- Assignment:	`= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=`
<br>

Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
- Expression: A construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
- Statement: tatements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution.
- Block: A group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
<br>

Control Flow Statements
- Decision-Making: `if-then if-then-else switch`
- Looping: `for while do-while`
- Branching: `break continue return`

## Compiling Java
To sum this up in a sentence, it is the the action a computer takes to gather the human-readable code and translate it into the 1's and 0's required to make it machine-readable.

## Java Documentation
The Java documentation on the Oracle website is actually pretty straight forward. The best way to find a top you are looking for is to either search for it by name/keyword in the Index search bar, or to search for a topic by System Class (the area of the code library that holds the methods and properties and closely related things as well).
