# Loops and Imports

## Loops
- For: Increments its own counter and iterates until a condition is met.
- Foreach: Iterates through each index of an array.
- While: Repeats as long as the starting condition remains true.
- Do-While: Runs the loop once before the evaluation even happens.

## Imports
To add reference to another Java file, the `import` statement should be at the top of the file followed by the file it is referencing.
